\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we first review the development of the \textit{federated primal dual} methods. Under the exploration of the experiments, we point out a serious challenge that hinders the efficiency of such methods, which is summarized as the ``dual drift'' problem due to the mismatched primal and dual variables in the partial participation manners. Furthermore, we propose a novel \textit{A-FedPD} method to alleviate this issue via constructing virtual dual updates for those unparticipated clients. We also theoretically learn its convergence rate and generalization error bound to demonstrate its efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate its significant performance.

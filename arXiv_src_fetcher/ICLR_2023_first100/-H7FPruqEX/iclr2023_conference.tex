% This paper introduces a novel design of model-free reinforcement learning, CASA, Critic AS an Actor. CASA follows the actor-critic framework that estimates state-value, state-action-value and policy simultaneously. We prove that CASA integrates a consistent path for the policy evaluation and the policy improvement, which completely eliminates the gradient conflict between the policy improvement and the policy evaluation. The policy evaluation is equivalent to a compensational policy improvement, which alleviates the function approximation error, and is also equivalent to an entropy-regularized policy improvement, which prevents the policy from being trapped into a suboptimal solution. Building on this design, an expectation-correct Doubly Robust Trace is introduced to learn state-value and state-action-value, and the convergence is guaranteed. Our experiments show that the design achieves State-Of-The-Art on Arcade Learning Environment.

\section{Ethics and  Reproducibility Statement }

This paper is aimed at academic issues in deep reinforcement learning, and the experiment used is also in the early stage, but it may provide opportunities for malicious applications of reinforcement learning in the future. We describe all details to reproduce the main
experimental results in Appendix \ref{app:hyperparameters}.

{\colorred This paper attempts to eliminate gradient inconsistency between policy improvement and policy evaluation.
The proposed innovative actor-critic design \textbf{C}ritic \textbf{AS} an \textbf{A}ctor (CASA) enhances consistency of two GPI steps by satisfying a weaker compatible condition.} %without introducing any bias of the original MDP.
We present both theoretical proof and empirical evaluation for CASA.
% Also, we propose an adaptive entropy control mechanism and prove the Lipschitz condition, instantiated as the Bandit Vote Algorithm in practice.
% The results show that our proposed method could achieve state-of-the-art performance standards with noticeable performance gain over several strong baselines when evaluated on ALE 200 million (200M) test suite.
% Our method is also very competitive compared with 10B+ scale algorithms.
The results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance standards with noticeable performance gain over several strong baselines when evaluated on ALE 200 million (200M) benchmark.
We also present several ablation studies, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method's theoretical properties. 
{\colorred Future work includes studying the connection between the compatible condition and the gradient consistency between policy improvement and policy evalution.}


% We have discussed the potential improvement of the method in future work.
% \section{Submission of conference papers to ICLR 2023}


% The experiment platform is open-sourced and we give version numbers and all pre-process details in appendix \ref{app:preprocess}.
% ICLR requires electronic submissions, processed by
% \url{https://openreview.net/}. See ICLR's website for more instructions.

% If your paper is ultimately accepted, the statement {\tt
%   {\textbackslash}iclrfinalcopy} should be inserted to adjust the
% format to the camera ready requirements.

% The format for the submissions is a variant of the NeurIPS format.
% Please read carefully the instructions below, and follow them
% faithfully.

% \subsection{Style}

% Papers to be submitted to ICLR 2023 must be prepared according to the
% instructions presented here.

% %% Please note that we have introduced automatic line number generation
% %% into the style file for \LaTeXe. This is to help reviewers
% %% refer to specific lines of the paper when they make their comments. Please do
% %% NOT refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will be removed from the
% %% style file for the final version of accepted papers.

% Authors are required to use the ICLR \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
% ICLR website. Please make sure you use the current files and
% not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for rejection.

% \subsection{Retrieval of style files}

% The style files for ICLR and other conference information are available online at:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://www.iclr.cc/}
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+iclr2023_conference.pdf+ contains these
% instructions and illustrates the
% various formatting requirements your ICLR paper must satisfy.
% Submissions must be made using \LaTeX{} and the style files
% \verb+iclr2023_conference.sty+ and \verb+iclr2023_conference.bst+ (to be used with \LaTeX{}2e). The file
% \verb+iclr2023_conference.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your paper. All you
% have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of the paper with
% your own.

% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
% sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

% \section{General formatting instructions}
% \label{gen_inst}

% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
% 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).
% Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of 11~points. Times New Roman is the
% preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2~line space,
% with no indentation.

% Paper title is 17~point, in small caps and left-aligned.
% All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

% Authors' names are
% set in boldface, and each name is placed above its corresponding
% address. The lead author's name is to be listed first, and
% the co-authors' names are set to follow. Authors sharing the
% same address can be on the same line.

% Please pay special attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


% There will be a strict upper limit of 9 pages for the main text of the initial submission, with unlimited additional pages for citations. 

% \section{Headings: first level}
% \label{headings}

% First level headings are in small caps,
% flush left and in point size 12. One line space before the first level
% heading and 1/2~line space after the first level heading.

% \subsection{Headings: second level}

% Second level headings are in small caps,
% flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
% heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

% \subsubsection{Headings: third level}

% Third level headings are in small caps,
% flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
% heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.

% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}

% These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.

% \subsection{Citations within the text}

% Citations within the text should be based on the \texttt{natbib} package
% and include the authors' last names and year (with the ``et~al.'' construct
% for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are
% included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis using \verb|\citet{}| (as
% in ``See \citet{Hinton06} for more information.''). Otherwise, the citation
% should be in parenthesis using \verb|\citep{}| (as in ``Deep learning shows promise to make progress
% towards AI~\citep{Bengio+chapter2007}.'').

% The corresponding references are to be listed in alphabetical order of
% authors, in the \textsc{References} section. As to the format of the
% references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
% consistently.

% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
% (12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}

% \subsection{Figures}

% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
% enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be
% hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line
% space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for
% first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

% Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure.
% Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption.

% You may use color figures.
% However, it is best for the
% figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
% either in black/white or in color.
% \begin{figure}[h]
% \begin{center}
% %\framebox[4.0in]{$\;$}
% \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
% \end{center}
% \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}

% \subsection{Tables}

% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn
% tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See
% Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
% title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case
% (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.

% \begin{table}[t]
% \caption{Sample table title}

% \section{Final instructions}
% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
% In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
% should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textsc{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
% numbered.

% \section{Preparing PostScript or PDF files}

% Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size ``US Letter'', and
% not, for example, ``A4''. The -t
% letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files.

% Consider directly generating PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+
% (especially if you are a MiKTeX user).
% PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however.

% Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
% \begin{verbatim}
% dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps
% ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
% \end{verbatim}

% \subsection{Margins in LaTeX}

% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+
% from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of
% the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps}
% \end{verbatim}
% or % Apr 2009 addition
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% for .pdf graphics.
% See section~4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps})

% A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command.

% \subsubsection*{Author Contributions}
% If you'd like to, you may include  a section for author contributions as is done
% in many journals. This is optional and at the discretion of the authors.

% \subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}
% Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
% acknowledgments, including those to funding agencies, go at the end of the paper.

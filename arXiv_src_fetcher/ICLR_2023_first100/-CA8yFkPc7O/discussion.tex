%% \section{Discussion and related work}

%% we provide a discussion on the observed phenomenon and compare our results with related work. 

%% \subsection{Setting where AT may hurt robust generalization}

%% In this section, we discuss the setting for which we showed (both theoretically and experimentally) that standard training beats adversarial training in terms of robust accuracy.

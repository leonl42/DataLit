\section{Reproducibility}

All hyperparameters used to produce our results are provided under each table or in Appendices B, C, and D. Additionally, our PyTorch code used to achieve the results for all three backdoors can be found at at \href{https://github.com/slkdfjslkjfd/augmentation\_backdoors}{https://github.com/slkdfjslkjfd/augmentation\_backdoors}.

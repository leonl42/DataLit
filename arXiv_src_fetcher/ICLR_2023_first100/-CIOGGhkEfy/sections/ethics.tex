\section{Ethics statement}

This paper explores backdoor attacks that can be inserted through data augmentation. For critical applications such as self driving cars, backdoors inserted by malicious attackers could have serious consequences. Therefore, in this paper we aim to encourage people to inspect their augmentation functions to ensure that any external code is clean.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we study the challenges of using 1-bit communication on Adam, and limitations of the state-of-the-art 1-bit Adam algorithm. We propose an algorithm named {\myalgo} that adopts two novel design: adaptive variance state freezing and 1-bit sync. We provide convergence proof for {\myalgo} and measure its effectiveness over baseline Adam and 1-bit Adam on various benchmarks, including BERT-Base/Large, GPT-2 pretraining and ImageNet.

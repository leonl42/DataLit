abstract = {Distinct scientific theories can make similar predictions. To adjudicate between theories, we must design experiments for which the theories make distinct predictions. Here we consider the problem of comparing deep neural networks as models of human visual recognition. To efficiently compare models’ ability to predict human responses, we synthesize controversial stimuli: images for which different models produce distinct responses. We applied this approach to two visual recognition tasks, handwritten digits (MNIST) and objects in small natural images (CIFAR-10). For each task, we synthesized controversial stimuli to maximize the disagreement among models which employed different architectures and recognition algorithms. Human subjects viewed hundreds of these stimuli, as well as natural examples, and judged the probability of presence of each digit/object category in each image. We quantified how accurately each model predicted the human judgments. The best-performing models were a generative analysis-by-synthesis model (based on variational autoencoders) for MNIST and a hybrid discriminative–generative joint energy model for CIFAR-10. These deep neural networks (DNNs), which model the distribution of images, performed better than purely discriminative DNNs, which learn only to map images to labels. None of the candidate models fully explained the human responses. Controversial stimuli generalize the concept of adversarial examples, obviating the need to assume a ground-truth model. Unlike natural images, controversial stimuli are not constrained to the stimulus distribution models are trained on, thus providing severe out-of-distribution tests that reveal the models’ inductive biases. Controversial stimuli therefore provide powerful probes of discrepancies between models and human perception.}}

abstract = {Humans are exquisitely sensitive to the spatial arrangement of visual features in objects and scenes, but not in visual textures. Category-selective regions in the visual cortex are widely believed to underlie object perception, suggesting such regions should distinguish natural images of objects from synthesized images containing similar visual features in scrambled arrangements. Contrarily, we demonstrate that representations in category-selective cortex do not discriminate natural images from feature-matched scrambles but can discriminate images of different categories, suggesting a texture-like encoding. We find similar insensitivity to feature arrangement in Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks. This suggests the need to reconceptualize the role of category-selective cortex as representing a basis set of complex texture-like features, useful for a myriad of behaviors. The human visual ability to recognize objects and scenes is widely thought to rely on representations in category-selective regions of the visual cortex. These representations could support object vision by specifically representing objects, or, more simply, by representing complex visual features regardless of the particular spatial arrangement needed to constitute real-world objects, that is, by representing visual textures. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we leveraged an image synthesis approach that, unlike previous methods, provides independent control over the complexity and spatial arrangement of visual features. We found that human observers could easily detect a natural object among synthetic images with similar complex features that were spatially scrambled. However, observer models built from BOLD responses from category-selective regions, as well as a model of macaque inferotemporal cortex and Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks, were all unable to identify the real object. This inability was not due to a lack of signal to noise, as all observer models could predict human performance in image categorization tasks. How then might these texture-like representations in category-selective regions support object perception? An image-specific readout from category-selective cortex yielded a representation that was more selective for natural feature arrangement, showing that the information necessary for natural object discrimination is available. Thus, our results suggest that the role of the human category-selective visual cortex is not to explicitly encode objects but rather to provide a basis set of texture-like features that can be infinitely reconfigured to flexibly learn and identify new object categories.}}

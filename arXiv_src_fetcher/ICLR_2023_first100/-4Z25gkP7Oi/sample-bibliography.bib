We formulate fairness as an optimization problem of finding a  good representation of the data with two competing goals: to encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously obfuscating any information about membership in the protected group.  We show positive results of our algorithm relative to other known techniques, on three datasets.  Moreover, we demonstrate several advantages to our approach.  First, our intermediate representation can be used for other classification tasks (i.e., transfer  learning is possible); secondly, we take a step toward learning a distance metric which can find important dimensions of the data for classification.}

	abstract = {As text classifiers become increasingly used in real-time applications, it is critical to consider not only their accuracy but also their robustness to changes in the data distribution. In this paper, we consider the case where there is a confounding variable Z that influences both the text features X and the class variable Y. For example, a classifier trained to predict the health status of a user based on their online communications may be confounded by socioeconomic variables. When the influence of Z changes from training to testing data, we find that classifier accuracy can degrade rapidly. Our approach, based on Pearl's back-door adjustment, estimates the underlying effect of a text variable on the class variable while controlling for the confounding variable. Although our goal is prediction, not causal inference, we find that such adjustments are essential to building text classifiers that are robust to confounding variables. On three diverse text classifications tasks, we find that covariate adjustment results in higher accuracy than competing baselines over a range of confounding relationships (e.g., in one setting, accuracy improves from 60% to 81%).},

  abstract = 	 {Generic generation and manipulation of text is challenging and has limited success compared to recent deep generative modeling in visual domain. This paper aims at generating plausible text sentences, whose attributes are controlled by learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics. We propose a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures. The model can alternatively be seen as enhancing VAEs with the wake-sleep algorithm for leveraging fake samples as extra training data. With differentiable approximation to discrete text samples, explicit constraints on independent attribute controls, and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators, our model learns interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces short sentences with desired attributes of sentiment and tenses. Quantitative experiments using trained classifiers as evaluators validate the accuracy of sentence and attribute generation.}

  abstract = 	 {The presence of gender stereotypes in many aspects of society is a well-known phenomenon. In this paper, we focus on studying such stereotypes and bias in Hindi movie industry (\it Bollywood) and propose an algorithm to remove these stereotypes from text. We analyze movie plots and posters for all movies released since 1970. The gender bias is detected by semantic modeling of plots at sentence and intra-sentence level. Different features like occupation, introductions, associated actions and descriptions are captured to show the pervasiveness of gender bias and stereotype in movies. Using the derived semantic graph, we compute centrality of each character and observe similar bias there. We also show that such bias is not applicable for movie posters where females get equal importance even though their character has little or no impact on the movie plot. The silver lining is that our system was able to identify 30 movies over last 3 years where such stereotypes were broken. The next step, is to generate debiased stories. The proposed debiasing algorithm extracts gender biased graphs from unstructured piece of text in stories from movies and de-bias these graphs to generate plausible unbiased stories.}

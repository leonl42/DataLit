\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

We have analyzed the augmentation strategies for video action classification task. We have introduced VideoMix, a simple, efficient, and effective augmentation method.
On Kinetics action recognition, VideoMix improves the top-1 accuracies of SlowOnly-50 and SlowFast-50 by $+1.3\%$ and $+0.5\%$, respectively. 
On Something-Something-V2 dataset, VideoMix brings $+0.9\%$ and $+0.8\%$ gains in top-1 accuracies on SlowOnly-50 and SlowFast-50, respectively. 
VideoMix also improves the localization ability of the classifiers: on weakly supervised temporal action localization (WSTAL), VideoMix consistently improves the localization accuracy over the baselines.
Finally, VideoMix improves the Kinetics-pretrained model for the transfer-learning task of video action detection. VideoMix, as well as VideoMix pretrained weights, provide a simple and cheap solution to boost up the video recognition performances across diverse tasks.

\section{Experiments}
\label{section:experiments}

We evaluate VideoMix in terms of the improved generalization performances as well as the transfer-learning performances of VideoMix pre-trained models on multiple tasks.
We first verify the effect of VideoMix on video classification tasks: Kinetics action recognition~\cite{kinetics} and Something-Something-V2. 
We show the temporal action localization performance via weakly-supervised temporal action localization experiments.
Finally, VideoMix is evaluated in terms of the transfer-learning performances on the video action detection task.
We also provide additional experiments on HMDB-51~\cite{kuehne2011hmdb} and UCF-101~\cite{soomro2012ucf101} action recognition benchmarks in Appendix~\ref{appendix:more_baseline}.  
All experiments were implemented and evaluated on NAVER Smart Machine Learning (NSML)~\cite{nsml} platform
with PyTorch~\cite{paszke2017automatic}

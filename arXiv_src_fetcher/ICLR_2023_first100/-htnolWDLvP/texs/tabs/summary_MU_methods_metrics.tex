         %We also listed five evaluation metrics to evaluate machine unlearning performance. 
         The marker `\textcolor{black}{\ding{51}}' denotes the metric used in previous research. The number in {\RTE} is the   run-time cost reduction compared to the  cost of {\retrain}, based on our empirical studies in Sec.\,\ref{sec: exp} on %with the data-model setup 
         (CIFAR-10, ResNet-18). Note that 
         {\GA} seems better than ours in terms of RTE, but it is less effective in unlearning.
         %\PS{Maybe we can add one sentence clarifying (for the eager-to-judge reviewer) that even though GA seems better in terms of RTE, but the performance loss compared to ours offsets its gain.}

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a novel generative network called AGN by introducing active learning. 
AGN can generate many new actions by means of motion transfer with only one or a few samples. 
The AGN consists of the MGN and the UMN. 
The MGN is able to implicitly learn the skeletal morphology of the target action while preserving the category features of the source action. 
The UMN utilizes uncertainty-inspired learning in active learning to provide an uncertainty score for the generation process and thus guides the MGN to improve the quality of the generation. 
AGN showed the best performance compared to the existing methods.FMD is 2.67, and Accuracy is 92.18\%.

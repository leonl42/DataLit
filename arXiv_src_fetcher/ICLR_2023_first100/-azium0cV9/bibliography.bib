@article{mpich_rabenseifner,
 abstract = {We describe our work on improving the performance of collective communication operations in MPICH for clusters connected by switched networks. For each collective operation, we use multiple algorithms depending on the message size, with the goal of minimizing latency for short messages and minimizing bandwidth use for long messages. Although we have implemented new algorithms for all MPI Message Passing Interface collective operations, because of limited space we describe only the algorithms for allgather, broadcast, all-to-all, reduce-scatter, reduce, and allreduce. Performance results on a Myrinet-connected Linux cluster and an IBM SP indicate that, in all cases, the new algorithms significantly outperform the old algorithms used in MPICH on the Myrinet cluster, and, in many cases, they outperform the algorithms used in IBM's MPI on the SP. We also explore in further detail the optimization of two of the most commonly used collective operations, allreduce and reduce, particularly for long messages and nonpower-of-two numbers of processes. The optimized algorithms for these operations perform several times better than the native algorithms on a Myrinet cluster, IBM SP, and Cray T3E. Our results indicate that to achieve the best performance for a collective communication operation, one needs to use a number of different algorithms and select the right algorithm for a particular message size and number of processes.},

 abstract = {Big data may contain big values, but also brings lots of challenges to the computing theory, architecture, framework, knowledge discovery algorithms, and domain specific tools and applications. Beyond the 4-V or 5-V characters of big datasets, the data processing shows the features like inexact, incremental, and inductive manner. This brings new research opportunities to research community across theory, systems, algorithms, and applications. Is there some new "theory" for the big data? How to handle the data computing algorithms in an operatable manner? This report shares some view on new challenges identified, and covers some of the application scenarios such as micro-blog data analysis and data processing in building next generation search engines.},

@article{bandwidth_optimal_allreduce,
 abstract = {We consider an efficient realization of the all-reduce operation with large data sizes in cluster environments, under the assumption that the reduce operator is associative and commutative. We derive a tight lower bound of the amount of data that must be communicated in order to complete this operation and propose a ring-based algorithm that only requires tree connectivity to achieve bandwidth optimality. Unlike the widely used butterfly-like all-reduce algorithm that incurs network contention in SMP/multi-core clusters, the proposed algorithm can achieve contention-free communication in almost all contemporary clusters, including SMP/multi-core clusters and Ethernet switched clusters with multiple switches. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than other algorithms on clusters with different nodal architectures and networking technologies when the data size is sufficiently large.},

@article{torus_allreduce,
 abstract = {Modern supercomputers with torus networks allow each node to simultaneously pass messages on all of its links. However, most collective algorithms are designed to only use one link at a time. In this work, we present novel multiported algorithms for the scatter, gather, all-gather, and reduce-scatter operations. Our algorithms can be combined to create multiported reduce, all-reduce, and broadcast algorithms. Several of these algorithms involve a new technique where we relax the MPI message-ordering constraints to achieve high performance and restore the correctordering using an additional stage of redundant communication.According to our models, on an n-dimensional torus, our algorithms should allow for nearly a 2n-fold improvement in communication performance compared to known, single-ported torus algorithms. In practice, we have achieved nearly 6x better performance on a 32k-node 3-dimensional torus.},

@article{survey_distributed,
 abstract = {The demand for artificial intelligence has grown significantly over the past decade, and this growth has been fueled by advances in machine learning techniques and the ability to leverage hardware acceleration. However, to increase the quality of predictions and render machine learning solutions feasible for more complex applications, a substantial amount of training data is required. Although small machine learning models can be trained with modest amounts of data, the input for training larger models such as neural networks grows exponentially with the number of parameters. Since the demand for processing training data has outpaced the increase in computation power of computing machinery, there is a need for distributing the machine learning workload across multiple machines, and turning the centralized into a distributed system. These distributed systems present new challenges: first and foremost, the efficient parallelization of the training process and the creation of a coherent model. This article provides an extensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field by outlining the challenges and opportunities of distributed machine learning over conventional (centralized) machine learning, discussing the techniques used for distributed machine learning, and providing an overview of the systems that are available.},

@inproceedings{proteus,
 abstract = {Many shared computing clusters allow users to utilize excess idle resources at lower cost or priority, with the proviso that some or all may be taken away at any time. But, exploiting such dynamic resource availability and the often fluctuating markets for them requires agile elasticity and effective acquisition strategies. Proteus aggressively exploits such transient revocable resources to do machine learning (ML) cheaper and/or faster. Its parameter server framework, AgileML, efficiently adapts to bulk additions and revocations of transient machines, through a novel 3-stage active-backup approach, with minimal use of more costly non-transient resources. Its BidBrain component adaptively allocates resources from multiple EC2 spot markets to minimize average cost per work as transient resource availability and cost change over time. Our evaluations show that Proteus reduces cost by 85% relative to non-transient pricing, and by 43% relative to previous approaches, while simultaneously reducing runtimes by up to 37%.},

@article{strassen_reloaded,
 abstract = {Conventional Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) implementations of Strassen’s algorithm (Strassen) rely on the existing high-performance matrix multiplication (gemm), trading space for time. As a result, such approaches can only achieve practical speedup for relatively large, “squarish” matrices due to the extra memory overhead, and their usages are limited due to the considerable workspace. We present novel Strassen primitives for GPUs that can be composed to generate a family of Strassen algorithms. Our algorithms utilize both the memory and thread hierarchies on GPUs, reusing shared memory and register files inherited from gemm, fusing additional operations, and avoiding extra workspace. We further exploit intra- and inter-kernel parallelism by batching, streaming, and employing atomic operations. We develop a performance model for NVIDIA Volta GPUs to select the appropriate blocking parameters and predict the performance for gemm and Strassen. Overall, our 1-level Strassen can achieve up to 1.11\texttimes{} speedup with a crossover point as small as 1,536 compared to cublasSgemm on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. With additional workspace, our 2-level Strassen can achieve 1.19\texttimes{} speedup with a crossover point at 7,680.},

 abstract = {Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99{\%} of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine.},

 abstract = {Due to medical data privacy regulations, it is often infeasible to collect and share patient data in a centralised data lake. This poses challenges for training machine learning algorithms, such as deep convolutional networks, which often require large numbers of diverse training examples. Federated learning sidesteps this difficulty by bringing code to the patient data owners and only sharing intermediate model training updates among them. Although a high-accuracy model could be achieved by appropriately aggregating these model updates, the model shared could indirectly leak the local training examples. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of applying differential-privacy techniques to protect the patient data in a federated learning setup. We implement and evaluate practical federated learning systems for brain tumour segmentation on the BraTS dataset. The experimental results show that there is a trade-off between model performance and privacy protection costs.},

@article{variability_aws,
 abstract = {Cloud providers employ sophisticated virtualization techniques and strategies for sharing resources among a large number of largely uncoordinated and mutually untrusted customers. The shared networking environment, in particular, dictates the need for mechanisms to partition network resources among virtual machines. At the same time, the performance of applications deployed over these virtual machines may be heavily impacted by the performance of the underlying network, and therefore by such mechanisms. Nevertheless, due to security and commercial reasons, providers rarely provide detailed information on network organization, performance, and mechanisms employed to regulate it. In addition, the scientific literature only provides a blurred image of the network performance inside the cloud. The few available pioneer works marginally focus on this aspect, use different methodologies, operate in few limited scenarios, or report conflicting results. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the performance of the internal network of Amazon EC2, performed by adopting a non-cooperative experimental evaluation approach (i.e. not relying on provider support). Our aim is to provide a quantitative assessment of the networking performance as a function of the several variables available, such as geographic region, resource price or size. We propose a detailed methodology to perform this kind of analysis, which we believe is essential in a such complex and dynamic environment. During this analysis we have discovered and analyzed the limitations enforced by Amazon over customer traffic in terms of maximum throughput allowed. Thanks to our work it is possible to understand how the complex mechanisms enforced by the provider in order to manage its infrastructure impact the performance perceived by the cloud customers and potentially tamper with monitoring and controlling approaches previously proposed in literature. Leveraging our knowledge of the bandwidth-limiting mechanisms, we then present a clear picture of the maximum throughput achievable in Amazon EC2 network, shedding light on when and how such maximum throughput can be achieved and at which cost.},

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

@article{model_parallelism_survey1,
 abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are becoming an important tool in modern computing applications. Accelerating their training is a major challenge and techniques range from distributed algorithms to low-level circuit design. In this survey, we describe the problem from a theoretical perspective, followed by approaches for its parallelization. We present trends in DNN architectures and the resulting implications on parallelization strategies. We then review and model the different types of concurrency in DNNs: from the single operator, through parallelism in network inference and training, to distributed deep learning. We discuss asynchronous stochastic optimization, distributed system architectures, communication schemes, and neural architecture search. Based on those approaches, we extrapolate potential directions for parallelism in deep learning.},

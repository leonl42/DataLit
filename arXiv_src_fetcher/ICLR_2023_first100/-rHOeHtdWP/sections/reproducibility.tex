\section{Reproducibility Statement}

\Cref{section:method:ratio} along with \Cref{fig:wide} show how we are altering the standard Transformer architecture.
The specific tasks we trained our Transformers on are given in \Cref{section:method:datasets} with details on the hyperparameters used for training in \Cref{appendix:tasks}.
The main body of our code can be found at GIT-LINK.

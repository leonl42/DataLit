% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\vspace{-.5em}
When learning task-oriented dialogue (ToD) agents, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can naturally be  utilized to train dialogue strategies to achieve user-specific goals. Prior works mainly focus on adopting advanced RL techniques to train the ToD agents, while the design of the reward function is not well studied. This paper aims at answering the question of \textit{how to efficiently learn and leverage a reward function for training end-to-end (E2E) ToD agents}. Specifically, we introduce two generalized objectives for reward-function learning, inspired by the classical learning-to-rank literature. Further, we utilize the learned reward function to guide the training of the E2E ToD agent. With the proposed techniques, we achieve competitive results on the E2E response-generation task on the Multiwoz 2.0 dataset. 
Source code and checkpoints are publicly released at \href{https://github.com/Shentao-YANG/Fantastic_Reward_ICLR2023}{https://github.com/Shentao-YANG/Fantastic\_Reward\_ICLR2023}.


% Left TODO Lists:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Multiwoz Dataset 2.1; 
%     \item Adapt our method for one more model: maybe consider the galaxy in the leaderboard;
%     \item Consider fair and benchmark evaluation of the script we mentioned.

%\yy{rewrite according to intro} 

%\jg{We did not compare with the Latest baselines, such as GALAXY and BORT, in Table 1, although you outperform them in low-resource settings. It would be better to mention them in introduction, related work or experimental analysis. Or you emphasize that SOTA is only one of your purposes as you are plug in, and you did not specifically pre-train on many ToD datasets and optimize response generation. Otherwise, ToD reviewers  with will criticize it. }

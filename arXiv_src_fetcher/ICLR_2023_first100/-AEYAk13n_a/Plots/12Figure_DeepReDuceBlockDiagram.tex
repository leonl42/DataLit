\caption{The DeepReDuce ReLU optimization pipeline.
The baseline is optimized left to right following orange arrows.
Green (plain) boxes indicate layer's with (without) ReLUs, gray boxes indicate profiling steps to guide optimizations, and blue boxes describe the resulting network after each optimization step. Given a baseline network, DeepReDuce outputs ReLU-optimized networks preserving as much accuracy from the baseline network
as possible.}

This repo is for the Data Literacy 2024 course project.

## Current TODO:
- Figure out how we'll measure complexity conceptually
- Figure out what we'll do for Analysis conceptually
- Decide on what format we'll use to represent the data throughout our process
### Code:
- Parse the jsons for NeurIPS and ICLR for scores and acceptance status, saving tex source files from arXiv (Linus)
- Extract Formulas from the tex source files per paper
- Calculate complexities for each paper
### Presentation
- Make Hypothesis/Intro Slides
  - Use hook as described
- Make Dataset Slides
  - Show where the data is from and how we're fetching it
  - Show examples of Formula Complexity
- Make Analysis Slides
  - What are we doing?
  - How does this test our hypothesis?

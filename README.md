# Info for tutors
You can find all submitted code in the `.Submission/Group_11_code` folder. 
Usage is explained either by the readme in the folder or by the markdown in the notebook.

The extracted math and feature data is contained in `.Submission/Group_11_data`. The full TeX data fetched from arXiv is uploaded on the [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/11j1fvj07mbns6amre42l/full_TeX_data_group_11.zip?rlkey=l8ew25gjn2v3fjuo908dr04gl&st=xzmanjh3&dl=0) linked in the team_info file.
